# Learning-Test-Driven-Development-With-NodeJs

In this repo, I will be documenting my journey to learn how to write unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests.

## What I've Learned ðŸ˜Š

1. What TTD is
2. Differences between unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests
3. Libraries or Frameworks to write Unit tests

For the tutorial I'm using to learn, I would be using **Jest** which is the most popular framework for writing unit tests, it comes with all the tools and features you need by default. While we have other frameworks like **Mocha, and Jasmine** some of them require external libraries and that's not what we want.

Jest was built by the Facebook open-source team so it is used at Facebook, Spotify, Airbnb, Twitter and other big companies.

I would also be using the **Jest Framework Documentation** to learn as well.
